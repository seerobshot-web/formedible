# Agent Guidelines for Formedible

## Build/Test Commands

FROM THE ROOT OF THE PROJECT !!! **ALWAYS**

- `npm run build` - Build all packages (uses turbo)
- `npm run build:web` - Build web app
- `npm run build:pkg` - Build formedible package only
- `npm run build:builder` - Build builder package only
- `npm run build:ai-builder` - Build ai-builder package only
- `npm run build:parser` - Build parser package only
- `scripts/quick-sync.js` - Sync components from formedible package to web app
- `npm run sync-components` - Sync components from formedible package to web app using shadcn cli

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- React functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Import paths: Use `@/` alias for src directory imports
- Naming: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/types
- Props: Define interfaces for component props, extend BaseFieldProps when applicable
- Error handling: Use try/catch blocks, log errors to console with descriptive messages
- Types: Prefer explicit typing, use `any` sparingly with ESLint warnings
- Exports: Use named exports for components, default export for main hooks
- File structure: Components in `/components`, hooks in `/hooks`, types in `/lib/formedible/types.ts`
- Formatting: Single quotes for strings, semicolons required, 2-space indentation
- React: No need to import React in JSX files (modern JSX transform)
- Dependencies: Check existing package.json before adding new dependencies
- Unused vars: Prefix with underscore to ignore ESLint warnings
- NEVER USE confirm OR alert ! anti pattern terrible UX ! NEVER !

## formedible work

- Always work on the packages first then scripts/quick-sync.js to sync the changes to the web app.
- use `npm run sync-components` to sync the changes before handing over to make sure shadcn install is functionning
- NEVER RUN THE DEV SERVER ! npm run dev IS COMPLETELLY OFF LIMIT ! NEVER npm run dev ! NEVER NEVER NVER !
- NEVER USE "any" IF YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ! THIS IS LAZY AND SHIT ! NEVER ! NEVER ! NEVER !

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES - NEVER BREAK THESE

**PACKAGES ARE THE SOURCE OF TRUTH - WEB APP IS SYNCED FROM PACKAGES**

1. **NEVER EDIT WEB APP FILES DIRECTLY** - ONLY EDIT PACKAGE FILES

   - ❌ WRONG: Edit /apps/web/src/components/formedible/ai/chat-interface.tsx
   - ✅ RIGHT: Edit /packages/ai-builder/src/components/formedible/ai/chat-interface.tsx

2. **WORKFLOW IS ALWAYS:**

   - Step 1: Edit PACKAGE files only, build the targeted package(s) to make sure change are ok !
   - Step 2: Run "scripts/quick-sync.js"
   - Step 3: npm run build:web
   - Step 4: npm run sync-components
   - Step 3: npm run build:web
   - Step 6: Done - web app now has the updated files
     MUST PASS TO GO TO NEXT STEP !

3. **NEVER UPDATE BOTH PACKAGE AND WEB APP** - This creates duplicates and sync conflicts

4. **PACKAGES MUST BE SELF-CONTAINED** - They bring ALL their dependencies through registry.json

5. **WEB APP GETS EVERYTHING FROM PACKAGES** - Never create duplicate files in web app

**IF YOU BREAK THESE RULES YOU ARE A FUCKING MORON AND NOT RESPECTING THE ARCHITECTURE**

**YOU WILL NEVER**

- add packages to a package.json file directly ! always use the package manager ! **ALWAYS**
- remove existing functionalities unless explicitely allowed !
- **NEVER** touch a public/r/\*.json ! **NEVER** THIS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN !
- registry.json are the source registry file! they are the one to be checked !
